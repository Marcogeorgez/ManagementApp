1-So, while I was working on the database, I started wondering how the editors are paidâ€”per month or per project. We want to record how many hours each editor works on a project with how many hours overtime or undertime, right? so after we record that are we going to use it in their payments? 


2-Regarding chat features: Guests can have chat with the company, right? (are there any specific premissions does they have other than having ability to have chat?)
Asking primarily how will they interact with the website after registering and logging in.
