Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components:

1. Users Table
    What it is: This table stores information about everyone involved in the project, including editors, clients, and administrators.
    Key Points:
        Each user has a unique ID.
        Users log in using their Google ID.
        Their roles (like Editor or Client) are recorded, which determines their level of access to the system.
        By default, new users start as Clients.

2. Roles Table

    What it is: This defines the different roles available within the system.
    Key Points:
        Roles include Admin, Editor, and Client.
        The default role for new users is Client, but an Admin can change this to Editor if needed.

3. Projects Table

    What it is: This table contains details about each video editing project.
    Key Points:
        Each project has a unique ID and a name.
        It includes descriptions, shoot dates, due dates, and a progress indicator showing how much of the project is completed.

4. Video Editors Table

    What it is: This links editors and assistant editors to specific projects.
    Key Points:
        It records which users are working on which projects and their specific roles (Editor or Assistant Editor).

5. Video Status Table

    What it is: This tracks the status of videos within projects.
    Key Points:
        It shows who is responsible for the video's status and what that status is.

6. Payments Table (In Progress)

    What it is: This manages payments for the work done on the projects.
    Key Points:
        It records how much time editors have worked, including regular and overtime hours.
        It tracks payments made to editors and whether clients can see specific payment details.

7. Archive Table

    What it is: This holds information about projects that are no longer active.
    Key Points:
        Only Admins can access this information.
        It records when a project was archived and the reason for archiving.

How It Works Together

    Users and Roles: Each user is assigned a role that determines what they can see and do in the system. For example, Clients can view project progress but cannot change any details.
    Projects and Video Editors: Projects are managed by linking them to the editors working on them, allowing for clear tracking of responsibilities.
    Payment Management: The Payments Table connects back to the Users and Projects to ensure that editors are compensated for their work and that clients are aware of payment statuses.
    Archiving: When projects are completed or no longer active, they are archived for future reference, ensuring that only Admins can access sensitive data.
