            <h3 id="done-last-week">Done Last Week</h3>
<p>*Adding secure setting for the access to the web app.
*Implemented the database as we've discussed (will re-iterate it later as we need)
*Created roles (Admin-Editor-Client-Guest) and made sure every new user is just a guest.
*Created the admin dashboard where we can change a user role.</p>

<h4 id="-improved-admin-dashboard-layout">-Improved Admin dashboard layout:</h4>
<pre><code>Done:
	Added a full-screen button for notes to enlarge it if you want to use it.
	Filtering Mode
	Notification when changing a user Role.
	Confirmation Dialogue when CHANGING ANY USER TO ADMIN FOR SAFETY.
	Toaster right bottom when the notes are saved.
	Saving the notes after .1 sec of stopping writing which removed the need for save button (I think it is better for user experience this way, what do you think?)
	Better looking grid with easily readable data.
	Notes are specific for user so if there are 2 admins for example, they can't see each other notes about others.

	Q1: Case Insensitive in filtering is currently ignored, would you like to enable it?
	Q2: Currently guest user can be changed to client/editor one by one, would you like a button for changing multiple at same time?
		if so, where would you like the button be?
	Q3: Would you like a button to delete users from the database? (like removing his entire account?)
	Q4: Would you like the selected role (the new role that will be set to) as a drop menu as it is currently implemented or something else?

<h4 id="-implemented-projects-page">-Implemented Projects page:</h4>
<pre><code>	Done:
		Where every user can see his own related projects only and editors will be able to see projects assigned to them.
		Implemented add projects button, where it opens a window to add project information ( will modify as needed later)
		Due date is 4 weeks after shoot date (as you said in our first meeting or is that wrong? )
		Added an Expand button for description to show in a full-screen mode
		Added basic view for admin/editor/client
				(Where everyone has his own things to see according to the access sheet you gave to me)
		Added dynamic name greeting (will take the name from google account when user signs-in for first time but for now I'm displaying his email)
	
	Q1:The client be the one who create the project? or only the admin can create and give access to the client? or how would you like it.
	Q2:Shoot Date and Due date will start from today right?  so it can't accept any date of older than today or should I let it free to add dates
		(for example if you'd like to migrate old projects from google sheets to the website.)
	Q3: Should projects delete-able? or it can only be archieved?
	Q4: just to make sure, Only the admin can assign editors to the project right?
